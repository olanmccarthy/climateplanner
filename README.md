# Personal Planner for Climate Impact Reduction
Final Year Project: Personal Activities Planner for Reducing the Impact on the Climate

Abstract: We all become more and more aware of our impact on the planet's climate. This project aims at increasing the personal awareness of this matter and, as a consequence, planning for living with the least detrimental impact on the climate. The project will have an information/learning component, a planning center and an evaluation component.

Description: The project analysis will focus on daily activities as well as holidays, assessing the impact of each activity on the climate. The planning center will suggest least detrimental actions by using a model of our activities. The evaluation will indicate our degree of success (or not) and possible new solutions. Of course, the system itself should use the minimum possible of resources.
